            <div class="card-content">
                <p>My name is Anthony Nguyen, student number is s3783719, 
                    and my student email address is s3787319@student.rmit.edu.au. 
                    I was born in Australia with a Vietnamese background, as both 
                    parents are Vietnamese. English is my first language, and with 
                    my Vietnamese background, I know a bit of Vietnamese. I have 
                    successfully graduated high school, completing VCE and was 
                    accepted into RMIT, and am currently in my third year in a 
                    Bachelor of Computer Science degree. My reasoning behind choosing 
                    RMIT was because I heard about it from my friends, it was offering 
                    SEAS for VCE students, and was a university which I considered to 
                    be “close” to where I live. Some of my hobbies include: playing computer 
                    games, cooking, and occasionally gardening. To pass time, and when I do 
                    get spare time, I usually play games, watch videos online (e.g. Youtube, 
                    Twitch), or simply listening music.
                </p>
                <p>My interest in the IT field started in high school, when I was 
                    chose game design as an elective. This was when I was first 
                    exposed to some form of coding from both the subject and my 
                    friend. I then began being interested in IT, both by the fact 
                    that it can make many people’s lives easier and more enjoyable, 
                    but is also capable of making other’s lives harder. After 
                    graduating, I hope to find a job in the IT field, such as 
                    Software Engineer/Developer.

                <p>
                    My interest in IT, as said before, started out in high school, 
                    when I was choosing my electives. I saw that there was a game 
                    design subject, and being interested in games, I decided to try 
                    it out. After going through that subject, and talking with my 
                    close friend, I began being interested in IT and other aspects 
                    of it. It initially started off as an interest in game design, 
                    but I realised I was more interested in playing them rather than 
                    making them (as I’m not much of an idea’s person). I then did a 
                    software development subject in VCE and was exposed to more IT 
                    related topics, and decided then that I would like to learn more. 
                    To this date, my only experience in IT is mainly from high school 
                    and university.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason I chose to study at RMIT was because it was one of the 
                    universities that I heard about the most, from both my friends and 
                    the teachers at my high school. It was also a university that I 
                    considered to be on the “closer” side to where I live. Both of 
                    the reasons combined, as well as it offering a Computer Science 
                    course with decent requirements and offering SEAS, contributed to 
                    my reason for choosing to come to RMIT.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From my studies, I expect to learn a lot about programming in 
                    different languages, as well as different practices that would 
                    be useful in the field. After learning these things, I expect to 
                    be somewhat prepared to enter the workforce with the required skills, 
                    both hard and soft skills.

                <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51695400?type=standout#searchRequestToken=111c91db-83c3-44bf-9ef1-cdd247f2ab63">
                Link to Job Advertisement</a>
                <p>
                    The job is as a Senior Software Developer, and requires quite a 
                    bit of experience. It’s a position where the company advertising 
                    is looking for someone who has experience but is also willing to 
                    try and learn new things while on the job. This job advertisement 
                    was somewhat appealing, mainly, due to the perks that they’ve 
                    advertised. My ideal job would be something that I’m comfortable 
                    with and is flexible, which is advertised in this. The requirements 
                    that are advertised are experience with writing clean, modular and 
                    maintainable Kotlin, however, they are willing to compromise if you 
                    have a background in Java development and would be interested in 
                    learning Kotlin. They also want some experience with relational 
                    and NoSQL databases, as well as someone with a mindset that focuses 
                    on the full software development lifecycle, not just one part of it. 
                    The company is also looking for someone who has experience with RESTful 
                    APIs, so I would assume they want some backend web-related development 
                    experience. The individual would ideally be willing to work with Python 
                    or TypeScript occasionally during their work. Version control, 
                    test-driven development, and agile principles are required. And 
                    finally, they are looking for someone who is willing to grow whilst on 
                    the job, and are willing to try new things.

                <p>
                    My current experiences/skills, in the past two years of university, 
                    are mainly experience in Java development, mainly focusing on backend 
                    development. I have some experience using SpringBoot for web-backend 
                    development, as well as Python Flask, which is also for web-development. 
                    I also have used C and C++ during my second year studying at RMIT. 
                    Some of my assignments have also lead me to working with RaspberryPis 
                    and some of its sensehat features. Some of the soft skills I have 
                    gained are mainly focused around working in groups, and although not 
                    officially, but stepping up and leading some of the groups. In 
                    regards to databases, I have used SQL in my first year of university 
                    to query databases.

            <div class="card-content">
                <p>
                    To gain some of the skills required by the advertised position, 
                    I plan to finish my university degree and then move into smaller 
                    rolls, such as graduate positions, before looking to go into a 
                    senior position. I am also currently taking a course relating to 
                    NoSQL databases, which will help me with one of the job requirements. 
                    Regarding the Kotlin, or Java experience, I already have some, 
                    but none in the actual workforce, so to build on this I would need 
                    to actually gain experience. This can be done similarly to the 
                    previous one, which is to get a smaller role in the workforce, 
                    and learn whilst on the job and from others.

            <div class="card-content">
                <p>
                    My results from doing the Myers-Briggs test is ISTP-A/ISTP-T, 
                    Virtuoso. The ISTP part of the results mean that I am a person 
                    with the personality traits: Introverted, Observant, Thinking, 
                    and Prospecting. From reading the brief description provided, 
                    this means that I am reserved, focusing more on myself, and will 
                    apparently tend to pursue goals without needing much external 
                    connection. It also talks about this personality type being the 
                    type to enjoy lending a hand and sharing experiences with others, 
                    especially with the people that they care about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on these results, the influence it will have on my behaviour 
                    in a team or group environment has both negatives and positives. 
                    The positives is that I am willing to lend a hand and help others, 
                    and vice-versa, but at the same time, I can work individually. 
                    I think this is an important aspect of teamwork or working in 
                    a group. Group members should be able to work on the work assigned 
                    to them individually, but at the same time, be willing to receive 
                    and provide help to others in the team. The negative of this 
                    personality type is the introverted part, being reserved and 
                    keeping to oneself. Although being introverted in itself is 
                    something I don’t think is a negative, but being too reserved is 
                    not ideal in a team setting. If I am too reserved when communicating 
                    with my team, progress won’t be made and others make think of me in 
                    a negative manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking this evaluation into account, when forming teams, I should 
                    think of having another member take up the leadership role, someone 
                    more outgoing. I should also try my best to contribute and 
                    communicate all members, ensuring that we are all on the same page.

            <div class="card-content">
                <p>
                    The online learning style test that I chose to do was the 
                    VARK test, which will tell me what learning style is suitable 
                    for me. The results from the test were: Visual = 11, Aural = 12, 
                    Read/Write = 5, Kinaesthetic = 12. From these results, I can 
                    tell that I am a more hands on type of learner (i.e. kinaesthetic) 
                    and an aural learner, with visual coming in second. I can also 
                    tell that learning through reading and/or writing is not my 
                    most ideal style of learning. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on these results, the influence they would have on my 
                    behaviour in a team is that when learning from others, or 
                    maybe even teaching others, I would prefer to have them walk 
                    me through the process and maybe even let me try whilst they 
                    guide/assist me. The negative of the results is that if someone 
                    were to try to teach me something through giving me something 
                    to read or tell me to write something done, then my learning 
                    speed would greatly be reduced. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking this in account, when forming a team, I would need to 
                    look for people who are able to teach others in this manner. 
                    I would also need to tell my team members when they want to show 
                    me how to do something, then they should using examples and 
                    explain it to me, instead of sending me a link to a website, 
                    as an example.

            <div class="card-content">
                <p>
                    The results of doing the IPIP Big Five Personality test are: 
                    Extroversion = 1, Emotional Stability = 22, Agreeableness = 5, 
                    Conscientiousness = 22, and Intellect/Imagination = 0. For the 
                    first value, extroversion, if someone scores highly in this 
                    category (or as they call it factor), then they are more likely 
                    to be outgoing and social. As I have scored very low, it is 
                    safe to say that I am very reserved and am not one to go out 
                    of my way to be social. The second factor, emotional stability, 
                    can be interpreted different ways due to it being referred to 
                    other names, such as negative emotionality. As such, as I scored 
                    highly here, it could either mean that I have the ability to 
                    keep my emotions in check, or the opposite, and that I let my 
                    emotions get the better of me. The third factor is agreeableness, 
                    as I scored low in this factor, the test says that I would be 
                    more critical and aggressing to other. The fourth factor is 
                    labelled conscientiousness, and as I have scored quite high, the 
                    tests says that I would am more careful and diligent, rather 
                    than impulsive and disorganised. The final factor is 
                    intellect/imagination, this factor is quite self-explanatory. 
                    As I have scored a zero in this factor, it means that I tend to 
                    be more traditional and conventional.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on these results, the influence on my behaviour in a 
                    team and when forming a team, is that I would need someone to 
                    make up for the factors that I scored low in. In my case, I 
                    would hope to find someone who is more extroverted, being 
                    able to enjoy communicating with others. To make up for the 
                    fifth factor, my team would need someone who is very creative, 
                    as I scored a zero, it shows that I lack an imagination and 
                    would most likely not be able to come up with amazing ideas. 
                    The third factor can’t really be made up for by my teammates, 
                    but this means that when I am communicating with my teammates, 
                    I would need to try to be patient and not so critical.

                    Due to my interest in gardening, the project idea that I 
                    have come up with I to have a device that has the ability 
                    to measure the hydration level of the soil around them. 
                    This idea came about from me lacking the knowledge of how 
                    much I should water plants, as it is very difficult to tell 
                    whether I have watered it enough or if I have watered it 
                    too much. By having this device, I would like to be able 
                    to water my garden a sufficient amount and even potentially 
                    save water from over watering.

                    My motivation behind this project idea is mainly fall into 
                    three reasons: saving water, saving money, and to provide 
                    the sufficient amount of water to my garden. All three 
                    reasons are closely linked to each other, and has the 
                    potential to be useful to other people other than myself. 
                    As water prices are slowly increasing, and has the potential 
                    to grow even more, reducing the amount of water used 
                    (or at least using the required amount) will have the 
                    potential to reduce the amount of money spent of water. 
                    And by using the right amount of water, and keeping the 
                    soil hydrated, the plants will have the potentially to grow 
                    at their ideal rate.

                    The product will feature some kind of detector/monitor, 
                    to monitor the hydration or moisture levels of the soil 
                    around it, and some kind of notifier, to notify the 
                    user of the levels. Regarding the detector, I know that 
                    a device like the RaspberryPi along with a moisture detector 
                    has the capabilities of the doing such a task. The idea 
                    would be that the device has multiple ways of notifying, 
                    or informing, the user of the moisture levels in the soil. 
                    One way could be via text or another form of phone 
                    notification, telling them when moisture in the soil is 
                    below a certain level. Another way,, which could be more 
                    accessible to people, is to have either different colour 
                    lights or a single multi-coloured light, that will show a 
                    different colour depending on the moisture level. Using the 
                    multi-coloured light source as an example for a form of 
                    notification, if the moisture levels are ideal the light 
                    would show green, and if they are below a certain level 
                    then it would turn red. Another feature that could be useful 
                    would be for a third level to be added, which will could 
                    possibly be a custom level that, which the user can set to 
                    any level between 100% and 0%. The usage of this third level 
                    would be to not let the soil reach a moisture level of 0% 
                    (or what the unit of measurement is). The reason would be, 
                    because most of the time you would not want the soil to be 
                    dried up completely, but instead keep it saturated, even if 
                    it doesn’t reach the ideal level.

                    An issue, or ‘feature’ that needs to be thought through, 
                    is the power source of this device. Even if the RaspberryPi, 
                    if the user has set the device to monitor the moisture 
                    all day every day, and has multiple of devices setup, 
                    the price of electricity may accumulate. A solution to this 
                    would be to make it solar powered, where it would use 
                    solar power during the day and at night it would switch 
                    over. Another feature that could be implemented would be 
                    an automated system to maintain the moisture level. This 
                    feature would turn on a sprinkler system (or another form 
                    of watering) for a certain period of time when the soils 
                    moisture falls below a certain point.

                    Some of the tools/technology needed for this project idea 
                    would of course be a RaspberryPi, which is, in a way, the 
                    ‘brain’ of this device. In addition to the RaspberryPi, a 
                    moisture sensor would also be needed, as this is the key 
                    feature of this device. Along with a power supply (either 
                    solar or cabled), these technologies would form the base 
                    of this proposed device. For the notification system, assuming 
                    that we are going with coloured lights, LEDs of some sort 
                    would also be needed.  Regarding the automated watering system, 
                    there are valves that are operated by electric signals. Which 
                    would be ideal for this device, as he RaspberryPi could just 
                    send an electric signal to the valve for it to open or close. 
                    This would allow water to flow through to either the sprinkler 
                    system or another watering device.

                    Regarding the skills required, the main one would be 
                    experience with RaspberryPi’s and experience with Python 
                    programming, as this is the main language used to program 
                    RaspberryPi features. Apart from the programming side, 
                    there is also some basic electrical wire work skills 
                    required. Although I doubt that there would be a need for 
                    a high level of knowledge, having someone who knows what 
                    they’re doing work on the wiring would be ideal. They 
                    would be able to do it the “right” way, and may even 
                    provide some useful information on how to do certain 
                    wiring better.

                    If this proposed project idea was to be brought 
                    to life and become successfully, the original problem 
                    of being able to water plants to the right amount and 
                    save money on water bills will be achieved. It also 
                    has the potential to grow into larger systems, such as 
                    for farms, as the proposed idea is mainly for household 
                    gardening. This idea may help out in the future as well, 
                    as the growing concern for climate change becomes more of an 
                    issue and droughts frequencies could potentially increase.
