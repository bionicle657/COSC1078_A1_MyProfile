            <div class="card-content">
                <p>My name is Anthony Nguyen, student number is s3783719, 
                    and my student email address is s3787319@student.rmit.edu.au. 
                    I was born in Australia with a Vietnamese background, as both 
                    parents are Vietnamese. English is my first language, and with 
                    my Vietnamese background, I know a bit of Vietnamese. I have 
                    successfully graduated high school, completing VCE and was 
                    accepted into RMIT, and am currently in my third year in a 
                    Bachelor of Computer Science degree. My reasoning behind choosing 
                    RMIT was because I heard about it from my friends, it was offering 
                    SEAS for VCE students, and was a university which I considered to 
                    be “close” to where I live. Some of my hobbies include: playing computer 
                    games, cooking, and occasionally gardening. To pass time, and when I do 
                    get spare time, I usually play games, watch videos online (e.g. Youtube, 
                    Twitch), or simply listening music.</p><br><br>
                <p>My interest in the IT field started in high school, when I was 
                    chose game design as an elective. This was when I was first 
                    exposed to some form of coding from both the subject and my 
                    friend. I then began being interested in IT, both by the fact 
                    that it can make many people’s lives easier and more enjoyable, 
                    but is also capable of making other’s lives harder. After 
                    graduating, I hope to find a job in the IT field, such as 
                    Software Engineer/Developer.</p>
